How it works
------------

The SLAP main server which is in charge of service coordination receives from participating servers the number of computer paritions which are available, the type of resource which a party is ready provide, and request from parties for resources which are needed.

Each participating server is identified by a unique ID and runs a slap-server daemon. This daemon collects from the main server the installation tasks and does the installation of resources, then notifies the main server of completion whenever a resource is configured, installed and available.

The data structure on the main server is the following:

 * A - Action: an action which can happen to provide a resource or account its usage
 * CP - Computer Partition: provides a URL to Access a Cloud Resource
 * RI - Resource Item: describes a resource
 * CI - Contract Item: describes the contract to attach the DL to (This is unclear still)
 * R - Resource: describes a type of cloud resource (ex. MySQL Table) is published on slapgrid.org
 * DL - Delivery Line: Describes an action happening on a resource item on a computer partition
 * D - Delivery: groups multiple Delivery Lines
