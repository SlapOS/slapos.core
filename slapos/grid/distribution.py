"""
Provides helper functions to check if two binary caches are compatible.

os_matches(...):
    returns True if the arguments reference compatible platforms.

patched_linux_distribution(...):
    a patched version of platform.linux_distribution()

    this is the same function provided with the python package in Debian and Ubuntu:
        see http://bugs.python.org/issue9514

    otherwise, Ubuntu will always be reported as an unstable Debian, regardless of the version.

distribution_tuple()
    returns a (distname, version, id) tuple under linux or cygwin
