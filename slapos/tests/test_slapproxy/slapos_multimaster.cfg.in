# For each section, you need to specify the URL of the SlapOS Master.
# For each section, you can specify if needed the location of key/certificate used to authenticate to this slapOS Master.
# For each section, you can specify a list of Software Releases. Any instance request matching this Softwrare Release will be automatically forwarded to this SlapOS Master and will not be allocated locally.
